# XenCenter API Extensions

The following section details the assumptions and API extensions that we
have made, over and above the documented API. Extensions are encoded as
particular key-value pairs in dictionaries such as `VM.other_config`.

|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| task.other\_config\["object\_creation"\] == "complete" |  For the task associated with a VM import, this flag will be set when all the objects (VMs, networks) have been created. This is useful in the import VM wizard for us to then go and re-map all the networks that need it.     |
