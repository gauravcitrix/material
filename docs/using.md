# Using the API

This chapter describes how to use the Citrix Hypervisor Management API from
real programs to manage Citrix Hypervisor servers and VMs. The chapter begins
with a walk-through of a typical client application and demonstrates how
the API can be used to perform common tasks. Example code fragments are
given in python syntax but equivalent code in the other programming
languages would look very similar. The chapter finishes with
walk-throughs of two complete examples.

## Anatomy of a typical application

This section describes the structure of a typical application using the
Citrix Hypervisor Management API. Most client applications begin by
connecting to a Citrix Hypervisor server and authenticating (for example,  with a
username and password). Assuming the authentication succeeds, the server
will create a "session" object and return a reference to the client.
This reference will be passed as an argument to all future API calls.
Once authenticated, the client may search for references to other useful
objects (for example,  Citrix Hypervisor servers, VMs, etc.) and invoke operations on
them. Operations may be invoked either synchronously or asynchronously;
special task objects represent the state and progress of asynchronous
operations. These application elements are all described in detail in
the following sections.

### Choosing a low-level transport

API calls can be issued over two transports:

-  SSL-encrypted TCP on port 443 (https) over an IP network

-  plaintext over a local Unix domain socket: `/var/xapi/xapi`

Switching from the XML-RPC to the JSON-RPC backend can be done by adding the suffix `/jsonrpc` to the host URL path.

The SSL-encrypted TCP transport is used for all off-host traffic while the Unix domain socket can be used from services running directly on the Citrix Hypervisor server itself. In the SSL-encrypted TCP transport, all API calls should be directed at the Resource Pool master; failure to do so will result in the error `HOST_IS_SLAVE`, which includes the IP address of the master as an error parameter.

Because the master host of a pool can change, especially if HA is enabled on a pool, clients must implement the following steps to detect a master host change and connect to the new master as required:

#### Handling pool master changes

1.  Subscribe to updates in the list of hosts servers, and maintain a current list of hosts in the pool

1.  If the connection to the pool master fails to respond, attempt to connect to all hosts in the list until one responds

1.  The first host to respond will return the `HOST_IS_SLAVE` error message, which contains the identity of the new pool master (unless of course the host is the new master)

1.  Connect to the new master

> **Note**
>
> As a special-case, all messages sent through the Unix domain socket
> are transparently forwarded to the correct node.

### Authentication and session handling

The vast majority of API calls take a session reference as their first
parameter; failure to supply a valid reference will result in a
`SESSION_INVALID` error being returned. Acquire a session reference by
supplying a username and password to the `login_with_password` function.

> **Note**
>
> As a special-case, if this call is executed over the local Unix domain
> socket then the username and password are ignored and the call always
> succeeds.

Every session has an associated "last active" timestamp which is updated
on every API call. The server software currently has a built-in limit of
500 active sessions and will remove those with the oldest "last active"
field if this limit is exceeded for a given `username` or `originator`.
In addition all sessions whose "last active" field is older than 24
hours are also removed. Therefore it is important to:

-  Specify an appropriate `originator` when logging in; and

-  Remember to log out of active sessions to avoid leaking them; and

-  Be prepared to log in again to the server if a `SESSION_INVALID`
    error is caught.

> **Note** A session reference obtained by a login request to the XML-RPC backend can be used in subsequent requests to the JSON-RPC backend, and vice-versa.

In the following Python fragment a connection is established over the
Unix domain socket and a session is created:

```python
    import XenAPI

    session = XenAPI.xapi_local()
    try:
      session.xenapi.login_with_password("root", "", "2.3", "My Widget v0.1")
      ...
    finally:
      session.xenapi.session.logout()
```

### Finding references to useful objects

Once an application has authenticated the next step is to acquire
references to objects in order to query their state or invoke operations
on them. All objects have a set of "implicit" messages which include the
following:

-  `get_by_name_label` : return a list of all objects of a particular
    class with a particular label;

-  `get_by_uuid` : return a single object named by its UUID;

-  `get_all` : return a set of references to all objects of a
    particular class; and

-  `get_all_records` : return a map of reference to records for each
    object of a particular class.

For example, to list all hosts:

```python
    hosts = session.xenapi.host.get_all()
```

To find all VMs with the name "my first VM":

```python
    vms = session.xenapi.VM.get_by_name_label('my first VM')
```

> **Note**
>
> Object `name_label` fields are not guaranteed to be unique and so the
> `get_by_name_label` API call returns a set of references rather than a
> single reference.

In addition to the methods of finding objects described above, most
objects also contain references to other objects within fields. For
example it is possible to find the set of VMs running on a particular
host by calling:

```python
    vms = session.xenapi.host.get_resident_VMs(host)
```

### Invoking synchronous operations on objects

Once object references have been acquired, operations may be invoked on
them. For example to start a VM:

```python
    session.xenapi.VM.start(vm, False, False)
```

All API calls are by default synchronous and will not return until the
operation has completed or failed. For example in the case of `VM.start`
the call does not return until the VM has started booting.

> **Note**
>
> When the `VM.start` call returns the VM will be booting. To determine
> when the booting has finished, wait for the in-guest agent to report
> internal statistics through the `VM_guest_metrics` object.

### Using Tasks to manage asynchronous operations

To simplify managing operations which take quite a long time (for example,
`VM.clone` and `VM.copy`) functions are available in two forms:
synchronous (the default) and asynchronous. Each asynchronous function
returns a reference to a task object which contains information about
the in-progress operation including:

-  whether it is pending

-  whether it is has succeeded or failed

-  progress (in the range 0-1)

-  the result or error code returned by the operation

An application which wanted to track the progress of a `VM.clone`
operation and display a progress bar would have code like the following:

```python
    vm = session.xenapi.VM.get_by_name_label('my vm')
    task = session.xenapi.Async.VM.clone(vm)
    while session.xenapi.task.get_status(task) == "pending":
      progress = session.xenapi.task.get_progress(task)
      update_progress_bar(progress)
      time.sleep(1)
    session.xenapi.task.destroy(task)
```

> **Note**
>
> Note that a well-behaved client should remember to delete tasks
> created by asynchronous operations when it has finished reading the
> result or error. If the number of tasks exceeds a built-in threshold
> then the server will delete the oldest of the completed tasks.

### Subscribing to and listening for events

With the exception of the task and metrics classes, whenever an object
is modified the server generates an event. Clients can subscribe to this
event stream on a per-class basis and receive updates rather than
resorting to frequent polling. Events come in three types:

-  `add` - generated when an object has been created;

-  `del` - generated immediately before an object is destroyed; and

-  `mod` - generated when an object's field has changed.

Events also contain a monotonically increasing ID, the name of the class
of object and a snapshot of the object state equivalent to the result of
a `get_record()`.

Clients register for events by calling `event.register()` with a list of
class names or the special string "\*". Clients receive events by
executing `event.next()` which blocks until events are available and
returns the new events.

> **Note**
>
> Since the queue of generated events on the server is of finite length
> a very slow client might fail to read the events fast enough; if this
> happens an `EVENTS_LOST` error is returned. Clients should be prepared
> to handle this by re-registering for events and checking that the
> condition they are waiting for hasn't become true while they were
> unregistered.

The following Python code fragment demonstrates how to print a summary
of every event generated by a system: (similar code exists in `CitrixHypervisor-SDK/XenServerPython/samples/watch-all-events.py`)

```python
    fmt = "%8s %20s %5s %s"
    session.xenapi.event.register(["*"])
      while True:
        try:
          for event in session.xenapi.event.next():
            name = "(unknown)"
            if "snapshot" in event.keys():
              snapshot = event["snapshot"]
              if "name_label" in snapshot.keys():
                name = snapshot["name_label"]
            print fmt % (event['id'], event['class'], event['operation'], name)
        except XenAPI.Failure, e:
          if e.details == [ "EVENTS_LOST" ]:
            print "Caught EVENTS_LOST; should reregister"
```

## Complete application examples

This section describes two complete examples of real programs using the API.

### Simultaneously migrating VMs using live migration

This python example (contained in `CitrixHypervisor-SDK/XenServerPython/samples/permute.py`)
demonstrates how to use live migration to move VMs simultaneously between
hosts in a Resource Pool. The example makes use of asynchronous API
calls and shows how to wait for a set of tasks to complete.

The program begins with some standard boilerplate and imports the API module

```python
    import sys, time
    import XenAPI
```

Next the commandline arguments containing a server URL, username,
password and a number of iterations are parsed. The username and
password are used to establish a session which is passed to the function
`main`, which is called multiple times in a loop. Note the use of
`try: finally:` to make sure the program logs out of its session at the
end.

```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        if len(sys.argv) <> 5:
            print "Usage:"
            print sys.argv[0], " <url> <username> <password> <iterations>"
            sys.exit(1)
        url = sys.argv[1]
        username = sys.argv[2]
        password = sys.argv[3]
        iterations = int(sys.argv[4])
        # First acquire a valid session by logging in:
        session = XenAPI.Session(url)
        session.xenapi.login_with_password(username, password, "2.3",
                                           "Example migration-demo v0.1")
        try:
            for i in range(iterations):
                main(session, i)
        finally:
            session.xenapi.session.logout()
```

The `main` function examines each running VM in the system, taking care
to filter out *control domains* (which are part of the system and not
controllable by the user). A list of running VMs and their current hosts
is constructed.

```python
    def main(session, iteration):
        # Find a non-template VM object
        all = session.xenapi.VM.get_all()
        vms = []
        hosts = []
        for vm in all:
            record = session.xenapi.VM.get_record(vm)
            if not(record["is_a_template"]) and \
               not(record["is_control_domain"]) and \
               record["power_state"] == "Running":
                vms.append(vm)
                hosts.append(record["resident_on"])
        print "%d: Found %d suitable running VMs" % (iteration, len(vms))
```

Next the list of hosts is rotated:

```python
    # use a rotation as a permutation
        hosts = [hosts[-1]] + hosts[:(len(hosts)-1)]
```

Each VM is then moved using live migration to the new host under this
rotation (i.e. a VM running on host at position 2 in the list will be
moved to the host at position 1 in the list etc.) In order to execute
each of the movements in parallel, the asynchronous version of the
`VM.pool_migrate` is used and a list of task references constructed.
Note the `live` flag passed to the `VM.pool_migrate`; this causes the VMs to be moved while they
are still running.

    tasks = []
        for i in range(0, len(vms)):
            vm = vms[i]
            host = hosts[i]
            task = session.xenapi.Async.VM.pool_migrate(vm, host, { "live": "true" })
            tasks.append(task)

The list of tasks is then polled for completion:

    finished = False
        records = {}
        while not(finished):
            finished = True
            for task in tasks:
                record = session.xenapi.task.get_record(task)
                records[task] = record
                if record["status"] == "pending":
                    finished = False
            time.sleep(1)

Once all tasks have left the *pending* state (i.e. they have
successfully completed, failed or been cancelled) the tasks are polled
once more to see if they all succeeded:

    allok = True
        for task in tasks:
            record = records[task]
            if record["status"] <> "success":
                allok = False

If any one of the tasks failed then details are printed, an exception is
raised and the task objects left around for further inspection. If all
tasks succeeded then the task objects are destroyed and the function
returns.

    if not(allok):
            print "One of the tasks didn't succeed at", \
                time.strftime("%F:%HT%M:%SZ", time.gmtime())
            idx = 0
            for task in tasks:
                record = records[task]
                vm_name = session.xenapi.VM.get_name_label(vms[idx])
                host_name = session.xenapi.host.get_name_label(hosts[idx])
                print "%s : %12s %s -> %s [ status: %s; result = %s; error = %s ]" % \
                      (record["uuid"], record["name_label"], vm_name, host_name,      \
                       record["status"], record["result"], repr(record["error_info"]))
                idx = idx + 1
            raise "Task failed"
        else:
            for task in tasks:
                session.xenapi.task.destroy(task)

### Cloning a VM using the xe CLI

This example is a `bash` script which uses the xe CLI to clone a VM
taking care to shut it down first if it is powered on.

The example begins with some boilerplate which first checks if the
environment variable `XE` has been set: if it has it assumes that it
points to the full path of the CLI, else it is assumed that the xe CLI
is on the current path. Next the script prompts the user for a server
name, username and password:

    # Allow the path to the 'xe' binary to be overridden by the XE environment variable
    if [ -z "${XE}" ]; then
      XE=xe
    fi

    if [ ! -e "${HOME}/.xe" ]; then
      read -p "Server name: " SERVER
      read -p "Username: " USERNAME
      read -p "Password: " PASSWORD
      XE="${XE} -s ${SERVER} -u ${USERNAME} -pw ${PASSWORD}"
    fi

Next the script checks its commandline arguments. It requires exactly
one: the UUID of the VM which is to be cloned:

    # Check if there's a VM by the uuid specified
    ${XE} vm-list params=uuid | grep -q " ${vmuuid}$"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "error: no vm uuid \"${vmuuid}\" found"
            exit 2
    fi

The script then checks the power state of the VM and if it is running,
it attempts a clean shutdown. The event system is used to wait for the
VM to enter state "Halted".

> **Note**
>
> The xe CLI supports a command-line argument `--minimal` which causes
> it to print its output without excess whitespace or formatting, ideal
> for use from scripts. If multiple values are returned they are
> comma-separated.

    # Check the power state of the vm
    name=$(${XE} vm-list uuid=${vmuuid} params=name-label --minimal)
    state=$(${XE} vm-list uuid=${vmuuid} params=power-state --minimal)
    wasrunning=0

    # If the VM state is running, we shutdown the vm first
    if [ "${state}" = "running" ]; then
            ${XE} vm-shutdown uuid=${vmuuid}
            ${XE} event-wait class=vm power-state=halted uuid=${vmuuid}
            wasrunning=1
    fi

The VM is then cloned and the new VM has its `name_label` set to
`cloned_vm`.

    # Clone the VM
    newuuid=$(${XE} vm-clone uuid=${vmuuid} new-name-label=cloned_vm)

Finally, if the original VM had been running and was shutdown, both it
and the new VM are started.

    # If the VM state was running before cloning, we start it again
    # along with the new VM.
    if [ "$wasrunning" -eq 1 ]; then
            ${XE} vm-start uuid=${vmuuid}
            ${XE} vm-start uuid=${newuuid}
    fi
